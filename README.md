## Description

\> Inspired by "Spotify Wrapped"'s concept, CLI-Wrapped offers you a retrospective of your terminal usage. It parses your history file to showcase your top 5 most used commands.

> [!Note]
> Unlike other applications, CLI-Wrapped does not (yet) isolate your commands from the past year but instead provides an overall ranking. (1)

> [!Warning]
> For the time being CLI-Wrapped only works on `zsh` (1)
